## Project Description
The online presence for Northern Sonoma County CERT, a community emergency preparedness program located in northern Sonoma County in northern California, United States, was created by Katja Schatte to help Northern Sonoma CERT. The current purpose of the website is to provide information about the upcoming Fire and Earthquake Safety Expo and allow both English- and Spanish-speaking community members to sign up as volunteer for the expo.

Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) are based on the National CERT Program, run by FEMA, the United States' Federal Emergency Management Agency. The local programs are administered by a local goverment agency, such as a police or fire department. The agency trains community members in basic disaster response skills, customized to the most prevalent emergencies in the respectie region. In California, these emergencies include earthquakes and wildfires. In the event of a major disaster, the trained volunteer emergency workers are equipped to support local first responders.

At the moment, the Northern Sonoma CERT is looking specifically for a website to allow community members to access the flyer, sign up for its upcoming Fire and Earthquake Safety Expo, and share photos after the expo. The program's primary mode of interaction and communication with the community is currently its Facebook page. A link to it features promintently on every page as part of the navigation bar. However, in the future, the purpose of the website will shift to a more general representation of the program and include a general description of the program's purpose and announcements of various upcoming events.

Currently, the general goals of the website are:
* Provide information about the upcoming Fire and Earthquake Safety Expo
* Allow community members to sign up for specific activties offered as part of the expo
* A photo gallery where the site admins can upload pictures from the expo after the event (currently contains test images)
* Provide all information and functionalities in both English and Spanish to make the website more widely accessible to the local community. (The website creator is an English<>Spanish translator, interpreter, and copy writer.)

## Features
#### Across Pages
Each page features a responsive **navigation bar** with a **language selection menu** (top left) and an easily recognizable **Facebook icon** linking to the program's Facebook page (top right).
Each page has a **footer** with **copyright information**. 

Every page features a background of a typical Sonoma County landscape (vineyards). The background image is cropped to make the content recognizable and aesthetically appealing across devices and screen orientations. 

#### Home
The landing page features the offical CERT logo as the **hero image**. The percentage of the screen the hero image covers increases for screens 768px and above in potrait mode and decreases for screens 768px and above in landscape mode to make the page visually appealing and the content below the hero image easy to locate. Below the hero image, visitors can find direct links to **the event flyer** in pdf format and the volunteer sign-up form. Depending on the language in which the visitor is accesing the landing page, they will be directed to the flyer and the sign-up form in either English or Spanish. In the future, the links to the current event-related information will be replaced with more general information about the program and updated links to event information. Due to the evolving business needs of the client, the homepage is designed in a way that its content can easily be updated and adapted. 

#### Events
Currently, the events pages features **information about volunteer roles** at the upcoming Fire and Earthquake Safety Expo and **sign-up form** that transmits the information directly to a Google spreadsheet using the _API Spreadsheets_ API. The form is optimized to usable on mobile screens and adapts to tablet and computer screens (768px and above).

#### Gallery
The gallery page currently features sample images demonstrating what the gallyery layout will look like once the event pictures get added to it. The standard setting of the **image grid** is one image per row. Above that, the grid features two images per row on screens 768px and above and three images per row on screens 1400px and above. The purpose of this structure is to allow users to clearly see the details of the images at first glance. In addition, the image gallery provides a **JavaScript-supported modal** that enlarge an image to full-screen size on click. After looking at the image, the visitor can return to the gallery by clicking ont the "x" in the upper right corner. Additionally, as soon as the menu bar is no longer visible on the screen, a **scroll-to-the-top button** appears in the lower right corner of the screen. On clicking it, the visitor is taken directly back to the top of the gallery.

### Acknowledgements
- I got the opportunity to build a website for a real-world project from Geoff Peters.
- My Code Institute mentor, Sebastian Immel provided helpful feedback regarding the behavior when I got stuck with my sign-up form. Thanks to his guidance, I tried coding the form validation adn submission pieces separately, which eventually solved my issue. (See [TESTING.md file](Testing.md) for details.)
- Dominik Habersack helped me located a bug in my form submission code, which prevented the sign-up form from submitting. (See [TESTING.md file](Testing.md) for details.)
